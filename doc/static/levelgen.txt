@page levelgen Levelgen Overview
Levelgens are a little different.  While the entire purupose of a bot is
to actively participate in a game, many levelgens will not stick around
after the level has been loaded. For a basic levelgen, the entire script
might be contained in the main() function -- it might create some items,
and do nothing more.

If a level has a levelgen script, its main function is executed as the
level is loaded, after all objects defined in the level file have been
created.  Therefore a levelgen can act upon those objects, either
altering them, deleting them, or by adding completely new objects.

Levelgens can also subscribe to events; their event handlers will be
called throughout the game as events are fired.

Unlike robots, levelgens are not automatically subscribed to the \e Tick
event.
