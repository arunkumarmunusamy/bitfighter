Any of your scripts can print a stack trace with the \e _stackTracer() command (see sample usage below).  This will show how you got to a particular execution point, and will print the values of various variables and other potentially useful information.  This can be very helpful if there are several conditions under which a function can be called, or why something went wrong.  

The \e print(msg) command will print a message the in-game console (which you can turn on with ctrl+/), and \e logprint(msg) will print a message to the console, the terminal, and the Bitfighter logfile.

Lua's \e [error](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-error) command will stop the script, print a message, and cause a stack trace to be printed.  Use \e [assert](http://luatut.com/assert.html) to confirm that a condition is true.

Finally, if you detect an unexpected error condition, you can log a message, trigger a stack trace, and terminate the script with Lua's error function.

\code
logprint("Here's a stack trace:")
logprint(_stackTracer())

if target == nil then error("Have a nil target!") end
assert(target, "Target should never be nil here!")
\endcode
