/**

@page events Subscribing to Events
@section Overview

Robots and Levelgens can register to be notified of certain game events.
When the event occurs, a specific function in the script (termed a "callback"
function) is invoked. This lets a script perform some action in response to
these events.

For a complete list of Events and their callback signatures, see the \ref
EventEnum page

@section Example
Subscribing to an event is the same for robots and levelgens: you call \link
LuaScriptRunner::subscribe `bf:subscribe` \endlink. Here is a simple example using
the MsgReceived Event which is available to both robots and levelgens:

@code

function main()
  bf:subscribe(Event.MsgReceived)
end

-- Whenever an event occurs which a script is subscribed to, Bitfighter will
-- run the function named after that Event.
-- For the `MsgReceived` Event, the name must be `onMsgReceived`
function onMsgReceived(msg, player, isGlobal)
  print(player:getName(), " said: ", msg)
end

@endcode
